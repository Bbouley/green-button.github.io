<dt>If a third party offers multiple applications that require on-going data, is it important for the data custodian to be able to distinguish which application the data is being transmitted for?</dt>

It is important to note that in the cases where the ThirdParty does not support single sign-on behaviors (i.e. each application may have a different user authentication mechanism) care must be taken to insure the appropriately authenticated user provided the opportunity to approve the authorization.</dd>
