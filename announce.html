Green Button creators, developers, industry vendors, utilities, and stakeholders will convene in southern California to celebrate “The Birth of the Green Button Ecosystem” and a vision of how Green Button will evolve going forward in a half-day event on February 6th 9:00A-1:00P PST.
<p>
Since its creation in 2012, the Green Button initiative has seen explosive growth in size and sophistication, gathering the stakeholders and components necessary for a successful effort to provide families and businesses with easy and secure access to their own energy usage information. Today, more than 60 million Americans (and 2.5 million Canadians) have access to their own “Green Button” data in a standardized format — creating new 21st Century opportunities to use private sector tools and services to manage and upgrade household and building energy performance. As milestones in 2014, electric utilities agreed upon a common information standard, industry vendors helped implement it, and customers began to take advantage of Green Button.  With public and private support, third party developers embraced Green Button as rocket fuel for their customer-driven goals. 
<p>
To ensure that implementations by all parties become more compatible and not less over time, and to ensure that new implementations conform to the needs of all stakeholders, a full test and certification program, established by UCAIug and Underwriters Laboratories LLC with development supported by NIST. The ecosystem is complete!  The event will celebrate the emergence of a young but complete ecosystem, just in time for California’s ambitious statewide adoption of Green Button Connect My Data, a fully automated and secure energy usage service common across all California Investor Owned Utilities.  With a Green Button ecosystem, it is time to turn promise into performance, and performance into profit.”
